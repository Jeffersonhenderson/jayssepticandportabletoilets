Planning my daughter's outdoor wedding was stressful, but Jay's made the restroom situation a breeze. We rented one of their bathroom trailers, and it was nicer than some indoor bathrooms I've been in! It was a bit of a splurge, but worth every penny for the comfort of our guests. The portable restrooms for weddings they offer are top-notch.<h2> - Linda P.
